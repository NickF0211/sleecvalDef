For every pair of events A and B, can you please answer the following questions:
Does occurrence of event A implies the occurrence of event B at exactly the same time, if yes,
please say A witness B, if no, please say A NOT witness B. For example, if A is a special type of B, then
occurrence of A implies the occurrence of B (DrinkingWater witness Drinking).
Please provide your justification for each answer in
the following Json format:

{
    "Relationship": {
        "event1": {name of EVENT A},
        "event2": {name of EVENT B},
        "justification": {your justification},
        "witness": {true or false}
    }
}


Please generate a single JSON file that includes some events pairs with witness relationship holds. Use your best judgement based on the semantics of the event names,
and please do not consider the rules.
Please try to provide at least 10 pairs that you are most confident with if they exist. If you cannot identify 10 pairs, try find as many pairs as possible.

For every pair of events A and B, can you please answer the following questions:
Does occurrence of event A blocks the occurrence of event B at exactly the same time, if yes,
please say A conflict B, if no, please say A NOT conflict B. For example, if A is the opposite action of B, then
occurrence of A conflict the occurrence of B (OpenDoor conflict CloseDoor).
Please provide your justification for each answer in

Please generate a single JSON file that includes some events pairs with conflict relationship holds. Use your best judgement based on the semantics of the event names,

Note that if A witness B and B conflict C, then it must be the case A conflict C. The pair you come up with must respect this relationship.

For every pair of events A and B, can you please answer the following questions:
Does occurrence of event A must happen prior to the occurrence of event B, if yes,
please say A HB B, if no, please say A NOT HB B. For example, if A is the pre-requisite of B, then
occurrence of A must happen prior to the occurrence of B (CreateForm HB ShowForm).
Please provide your justification for each answer in

For every pair of boolean measures A and B, can you please answer the following questions:
Is it the case that if A holds then B must hold, if yes,
please say A implies B, if no, please say A NOT implies B. For example, if A is a stronger condition than B, then
A implies B (doorLocked implies doorClosed).
Please provide your justification for each answer in

For every pair of boolean measures A and B, can you please answer the following questions:
Is it the case that if A holds then B must not hold, if yes,
please say A ME B, if no, please say A NOT ME B. ME stands for mutually exclusive. For example, if A and B represents two mutually exclusive states, then
A ME B (in the context of traffic light, redLightOn conflicts greenLightOn).

For every pair of measures A and B, can you please answer the following questions:
Is it the case that if A and B always have the same value, if yes,
please say A equals B, if no, please say A NOT equals B. For example, if A and B represent the same measures with two different name, then
